### Professional Profile

I am a cybersecurity professional focused on **Offensive Security**, with a hands-on, methodology-driven approach to understanding how real-world attacks are executed against systems, networks, and applications.

My technical development emphasizes the complete attack lifecycle, including reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation, privilege escalation, and persistence. I aim to understand not only how vulnerabilities are exploited, but how weaknesses are chained to achieve meaningful compromise and operational impact.

I am actively building expertise in **penetration testing, malware analysis, reverse engineering, and offensive tooling**, with practical experience in controlled environments and a strong commitment to ethical and responsible security practices.

- Reverse engineering for behavioral analysis and threat comprehension  
- Study of defensive controls and mitigation strategies from an attacker’s perspective  

### Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation
- Identification of privilege escalation vectors on Linux and Windows systems  
- Analysis of insecure permissions, services, and system configurations  
- Study of persistence techniques and lateral movement strategies  
- Understanding of attacker tradecraft after initial access  

### Offensive Tooling & Automation
- Development of custom offensive tools and scripts using Python  
- Automation of reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation tasks  
- Creation of reusable tooling to support structured penetration testing workflows  
- Maintenance of technical repositories and documentation  

### Labs and Realistic Environments
- Design and deployment of vulnerable lab environments using legacy and modern systems  
- Simulation of corporate networks and realistic attack paths  
- Controlled execution of offensive techniques to validate learning outcomes  
- Documentation of findings, techniques, and lessons learned

## Professional Approach

My development is guided by **consistency, technical depth, and realism**. I prioritize understanding attacker mindset and tradecraft while maintaining a strong ethical foundation. Clear documentation, reproducibility, and continuous improvement are integral parts of my workflow.

I aim to progressively move toward more advanced offensive roles by combining **technical execution, analytical thinking, and strategic understanding of security weaknesses**.
